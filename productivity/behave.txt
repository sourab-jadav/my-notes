rejection is the story that you tell you to yourself

the best way to respond to it is accecpting the way it as part of your life and selfflshly see what you can gain from it

maybe ask for the feedback to help you do better the next time

they also want to makesure that you fit into their company's culture as you candidate they want you to embrace their core values and makesure
that you fit into their management leadership style

makesure that you align with their values unless you you want to hate your job for the next 10 years
